# `jadob/jadob` Documentation

This is a directory where a whole project documentation should be stored.

## Directory structure

- `components` - Related to single components
- `development` - Related to framework development/contribution
- `framework` - Related to building an application using `jadob/jadob`
- `releases` - More detailed things about each release (bc breaks, migration scripts etc.)

If you are building things by using this project, you can safely ignore `development` directory as it is related only for
project contributors.
